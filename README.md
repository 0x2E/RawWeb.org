## Intro

We miss the golden age of the internet when people thought, wrote, and shared on their personal websites and blogs.

That’s why we’ve built this search engine to help you discover and explore content from personal websites.

## How the crawler works

Our crawler is designed to be considerate of your website's resources.

- It will request the feed link using the User-Agent `rawweb-bot/1.0`.
- The time between requests will vary from 30 minutes to 48 hours, depending on several factors.

## Feed sources

In addition to user submissions, we've imported multiple large feed sources. We're grateful for all of this wonderful work.
