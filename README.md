## Intro

We miss the golden age of the internet when people thought, wrote, and shared on their personal websites and blogs.

Thatâ€™s why weâ€™ve built this search engine to help you discover and explore content from personal websites.

## How the crawler works

Our crawler is designed to be considerate of your website's resources.

- It will request the feed link using the User-Agent rawweb-bot/1.0.
- The time between requests will vary from 30 minutes to 48 hours, depending on several factors.

## Feed sources

In addition to user submissions, we've imported multiple large feed sources. We're grateful for all of this wonderful work.
